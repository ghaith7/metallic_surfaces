# metallic surfaces defect classification

In metallurgy There are several defects in metallic surfaces that need to be detected then treated in most industrual processes, in this project I try to implement a solution to automate this.

### Data

Original data can be found here [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alex000kim/magnetic-tile-surface-defects)

### Model

We used Transfer Learning with Xeption model. we trained it for 4 epochs.

### Results
